# project_peanutsandcrackerjack
A series of projects exploring the Chadwick Baseball Databank

This repo contains code that analyzes the Chadwick Baseball Databank which can be found here:
https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank 

## Folder:  Top_Hitters_OPS
This folder contains the R markdown code for the analysis that supports my blog entry at Cramer-Krasselt.

To perform this analysis, I set up a Postgres database on my local machine that contains all of the Chadwick Baseball Databank files as tables.  I also created a view of the players hitting stats - details can be found in the Data_ETL folder in this repo.
